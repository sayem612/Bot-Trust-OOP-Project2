CISC 3150 OOP PROJECT 2 -- SIMULATION OF THE (GOOGLE CODE JAM) BOT TRUST PROBLEM

###Project Requirement
 Project 2

Many of the Google Code Jam problems, such as games, racing cars, and robots, can be solved by using simulation. For example, the Bot Trust problem can be solved by simulating how robots push the buttons; the Graduation Requirements problem can be solved by simulating how the car can drive without meeting with any other car when starting at a different intersection at a different time. Choose one from the practice problems and write a simulator in Java or C++ for solving the problem. Your simulator must meet the following requirements:

    It must correctly simulate a solution for the small data set.
    It must provide a GUI that visualizes the solution.
    It should use multiple threads to simulate multiple actors if there are multiple actors involved. 

Please make your project available on a web site, such as GitHub or SourceForge, and email a link to the page with the subject "Project-2: Name" to: cisc3150@picat-lang.org. All projects that meet the minimum requirements will receive 15 points. Outstanding projects will be awarded 5 extra points.
